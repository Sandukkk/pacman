# pacman
This project is a simple Pacman game developed in C language as part of our third semester coursework. Our team implemented the game logic using C and integrated graphics with the help of the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). The code was written in Visual Studio Code, and the game features basic gameplay mechanics including player movement, ghost chasing, and point collection.
